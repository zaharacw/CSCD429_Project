    "\n",
    "When looking at this data from a tokenized perspective, many of the individual words don't offer us much in terms of helping a machine to understand text (derive semantic meaning) appropriately. Additionally the more data we are working with, the harder it is to train a model; especially in the deep learning space where computation requirements skyrocket. Our main goal from each headline is do identify the importent identities (names, places, concrete/nouny stuff) and part of speech identification. The interconnecting fabric to these external objectives is what's called [stop words](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/dropping-common-terms-stop-words-1.html). Essentially, a stop word refers to a variety of clarifying adjectives and various conjunction words. In terms of deciphering the knowledge to be gained from a sentence these words offer little value.\n",
